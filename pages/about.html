                    have a
                    personal life (yeah really!). I’m a father, and a responsible family member of 12 people(+3 in next
                    few years), I am first person from family to go to school, did Master Degree in Computer
                    Applications.

                <p>I’m a nerd and I am proud of it. My life is a busy one. Being a family man, creating time for the

                    around me, having a full-time job, create time for my hobby, is like juggling ten balls at the same

                <p>Years ago I decided to become more productive in my life and started working on systems to achieve
                    that
                    goal. You’d probably had one (or more) of those todo-lists right? Yeah… Thought so… so did I. They
                    grow,
                    become obsolete, and eventually forgotten. But still many thoughts popping in my brain, some of them
                    partially completed sitting in GitHub, some of them are at the initial stage stopped after creating
                    JDL(UML), and some of them are sitting as stories on my google keep, which takes the whole day to
                    read
                    about all of them.</p>

                <p>Me as a Platform Engineer > DevOps Manager, I have gone through all the areas of the application. I
                    will cover my
                    experience as a blog covering create application with scaffolding tools and configuration for
                    deploying apps as container I also provide configurations for Observability-Driven Development, for
                    the security and performance</p>
                <p>I use a method called “GTD” (Getting Things Done) and developed my own habits and disciplines in the
                    past
                    years. Happy Productivity!</p>
