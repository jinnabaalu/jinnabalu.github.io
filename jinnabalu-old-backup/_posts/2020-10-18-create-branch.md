## Checkout to main branch

git checkout develop
```

## Pull Letest

```bash
git pull
```

## Create new branch

```bash
git checkout -b jinnabalu/brnachName
```

`jinnabalu`: user name of the github, to recognize the user by branch name easily when working with team

`branchName`: brnachName for readability we maintain [NamingConvension](https://github.com/JinnaBalu/GitCheatSheet/blob/master/NamingConvension.md#naming-convention-for-programming) for naming the branch.
