                My name is Jinna Balaiah in certificates, but internet and all my friends know me as Balu, I also have a
                personal life (yeah really!). I’m a father, and a responsible family member of 11 people(+3 in next few years), I am first person from family to go to school, did Master Degree in Computer Applications.  
            </p>
            <p>I’m a nerd and I am proud of it. My life is a busy one. Being a family man, creating time for the people
                around me, having a full-time job, create time for my hobby, is like juggling ten balls at the same
                time. We all got the same 24 hours in a day and the time doesn’t wait or stop.</p>

            <p>Years ago I decided to become more productive in my life and started working on systems to achieve that
                goal. You’d probably had one (or more) of those todo-lists right? Yeah… Thought so… so did I. They grow,
                become obsolete, and eventually forgotten. But still many thoughts popping in my brain, some of them
                partially completed sitting in GitHub, some of them are at the initial stage stopped after creating
                JDL(UML), and some of them are sitting as stories on my google keep, which takes the whole day to read
                about all of them.</p>

            <p>Me as a Platform Engineer > DevOps Manager, I have gone through all the areas of the application. I
                will cover my
                experience as a blog covering create application with scaffolding tools and configuration for
                deploying apps as container I also provide configurations for Observability-Driven Development, for
                the security and performance</p>
            <p>I use a method called “GTD” (Getting Things Done) and developed my own habits and disciplines in the past
                years. Happy Productivity!</p>
